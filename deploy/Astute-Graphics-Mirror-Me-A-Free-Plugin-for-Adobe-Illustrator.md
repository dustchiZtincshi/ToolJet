Once you have installed the plugins, you can launch Illustrator and open a document. To activate Mirror Me, go to Window > Astute Graphics > MirrorMe. A panel will appear where you can adjust the settings of the symmetry.
 
You can choose the number of axes, the angle, the origin and the color of the mirror lines. You can also apply the symmetry to a layer or a selection.
